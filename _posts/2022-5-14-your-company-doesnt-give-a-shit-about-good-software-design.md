title: Your company doesn't give a shit about good software design

Interfaces, Polymorphism, Design Patterns, architecture, SOLID Design principles, writing code that is scalable and extendable - why do we care so much about all this stuff? 

Because we think that good software design matters - it is what distinguishes mediocre software engineers from great ones. And being recognized as a great software engineer within your company will lead to both fame and fortune.

> Newsflash - Your company doesn't give a shit about good software design 

<br>

When I joined the tech world as a starry-eyed fresher, I was immediately bewildered to see that most of the engineers around me were extremely mediocre. Sure they could get a new project up and running, but their codebases resembled a bowl of freshly baked spaghetti with zero thought put into the scalability, extendability, or good architecture and design of code they had written.


<br>

Surely, this charade couldn't continue for long. Surely, one day they would get caught - their mediocrity exposed to the entire world. Right?


<br>

And, by contrast, since I put extensive thought into the design and architecuture of the code I was writing, my greatness would surely be discovered and acknowledged by the whole company one day. Right?

<br>

I wouldn't lie - that was my biggest fantasy during my first few years in the tech industry.

<br>

But five years later, no such thing has happened. The mediocre engineers still continue to work at the same company, having faced absolutely no repurcussions for their mediocre code. And I too work for the same company, having received zero recognition for the extensive love and care I put into the design of my codebases.

<br>

It's as if the company doesn't care!
