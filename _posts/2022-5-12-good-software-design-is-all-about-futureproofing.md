title: Good Software Design is all about Futureproofing

"Good software design" is a pretty overloaded term. It might mean a lot of things in a lot of contexts. Off the top of my head, here are some of the things I associate with good software design - 

1. Design Patterns
2. SOLID Design Principles
3. Interfaces and Ploymorphism
4. Architecture
5. Writing scalable, extendable, and maintainable code

etc.

Every single one of these topics appears to be compeltely distinct from the others, and this diversity might prove detimental for the beginners who are trying to understand or visualize -  what exactly is meant my good software design?

That's where I come in.

I will give you a mantra that distils the essence of good software design, and unifies all the diverse subtopics under a single theme -
